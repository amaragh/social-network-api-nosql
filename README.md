# Social Network API

## Description

Social networking platforms use many of the tools we are encountering as part of this full-stack course. To facilitate the creation of the API for a social networking application, we are using Express.js, MongoDB and Mongoose, which, together, will allow us to execute CRUD methods on the different obects within the app.

## Installation

Clone the repo, then from the command line, run `npm install` in the project's root directory to download any dependencies.

## Usage

The video demo can be found [here](https://youtu.be/rGBhVy8wu7Y).

Navigate to project root directory and run the command `npm start` to start the server. You will then be able to send various requests to the server to view, add, update and remove data from the database.

For example, if testing from the localHost, send a GET request to the endpoint `http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts/` to retrieve all thoughts created. Each thought will appear in the response with the asociated user and reactions to any individual thoughts.
